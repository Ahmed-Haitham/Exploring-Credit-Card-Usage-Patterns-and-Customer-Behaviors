## **Exploring-Credit-Card-Usage-Patterns-and-Customer-Behaviors:** An Analysis using Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

**Project Description**

The project aims to explore credit card usage patterns and customer behaviors by analyzing a credit card dataset. The insights generated from the analysis will help in understanding the spending habits and frequency of customers, their payment behaviors and the distribution of various transactions made using the credit card.

The analysis involves applying various clustering algorithms, including Kmeans, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical, to segment the customers based on their credit card usage patterns. The results of the clustering algorithms are then visualized using t-SNE to gain a better understanding of the customer segments.

Furthermore, the project also applies two dimensionality reduction techniques, PCA and KPCA, to the data to simplify the complexity and retain the important features. The same clustering algorithms are then applied after the dimensionality reduction to see the impact of the reduction on the clustering results.

The quality of the clustering results is evaluated using three quality measures - Silhouette Score, Davies Bouldin Score, and Calinski Harabasz Score. The results of this analysis will help in gaining a deeper understanding of the credit card usage patterns and customer behaviors and aid in identifying key customer segments for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.
